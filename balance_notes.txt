"The game's monster difficulty should increase slightly faster than the advancement of the player,
 given average stats and default equipment, so as to force him to rely upon items and tactics.

The reasoning here is that if the player doesn't have to rely on randomly-found stuff they 
will likely lose interest in playing. However, if it's required to have specific items to be 
successful then many games will be outright unwinnable. The balance between these two poles 
is what makes random dungeon generation difficult, but it's also part of what makes random dungeon 
gameplay interesting."
