"The game's monster difficulty should increase slightly faster than the advancement of the player,
 given average stats and default equipment, so as to force him to rely upon items and tactics.

The reasoning here is that if the player doesn't have to rely on randomly-found stuff they 
will likely lose interest in playing. However, if it's required to have specific items to be 
successful then many games will be outright unwinnable. The balance between these two poles 
is what makes random dungeon generation difficult, but it's also part of what makes random dungeon 
gameplay interesting."

"For example, for the implementation of a simple ‘Combat’ Action, you may decide that your variables 
to calculate the ‘Strength of the blow’ are:

The ‘strength’ of the performer
The ‘proficiency’ with the given weapon kind
The ‘strength’ of the weapon
You will also need to calculate the chance for the blow to fail, and state the following variables:

The dexterity of the enemy
The weight of the enemy
The evade bonus of the enemy, based on his equipped accesories
Finally you will need some sort of health, so that the final effect of the blow is perceived."
