# Rogue_simple
A classic Roguelike

## TODO:[Complexity out of 10, Time out of 10]
- Stairs [2,2]
- Creature-limbs [4,6]
- Attack-Targeting [6,5]
- Map-gen round 2 [8,10]
- ai [6,4]

## To Fix/Do:

 - Doors appearing adjacent to walls. (Can't enter this room, especially if there is one door).
 - Doors still depreciate after their lock has given-way, we can have the door become a smashed object, if it reaches `-20` for eg.
 - Need to Drop items from attire, not just inventory.
 - hp increasing items need to do % based increases - this is to aid Creatures with less than max Health.
 - a second type of map gen - play.py is becoming a level gen module.
